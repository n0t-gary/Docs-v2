Instance 1:
```
-network server -world res://samples/worlds/baseplate.poly
```

Instance 2:
```
-network client -id 64499
```

!!! tip "About the ID"
    The ID can also be your user ID!

!!! failure "About Feature tags"
    Make sure the feature tags does not contain other entry flags (or just keep it empty!), we don't need them in client launching.

4. Press Run Project
